## What is Embark?

A monorepo framework that automates everything between **code** and **production**. Create a package, commit, push — it's deployed. Each package in the monorepo is published individually: a push only deploys new or changed packages, not everything.

### Key Concepts

- **One push ≠ deploy everything** — Only packages with actual changes are built and deployed. The rest stay untouched.
- **Each package = its own pipeline** — Every package gets a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow with path filters.
- **Choose your infra** — Cloud Run with auto-generated Docker + CI/CD, Netlify with just a config file, or bring your own. Per package.
- **Zero config** — Workflows, Dockerfiles, and README are auto-generated on commit. You just write code.
- **AI-Powered setup** — Connect your favorite AI (Claude, Gemini, Copilot) to auto-generate Dockerfiles tailored to your stack.
- **Embed anywhere** — Deploy frontend packages to Netlify or static hosts and embed them via `<iframe>` in any system, site, or dashboard.
- **Dev + AI teamwork** — Code with your team while AI handles boilerplate, tests, and deployment pipelines. Stay in control.

## Stack

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| [Bun](https://bun.sh) | Runtime, bundler, test runner, package manager |
| TypeScript | Strict mode, no `any` |
| GitHub Actions | Auto-generated CI/CD per package |
| Docker | Auto-generated Dockerfiles (AI or default) |
| Cloud Run | Serverless container deploy |
| Netlify | Static/JAMstack deploy (no Docker needed) |
| Husky | Git hooks (pre-commit & pre-push) |

## Getting Started

```bash
# clone & install
git clone https://github.com/blpsoares/embark.git
cd embark
bun install

# create a new package (interactive)
bun run new-package

# commit — automations run automatically
git add . && git commit -m "feat: my new app"

# push — only changed packages deploy
git push origin main
```

## Creating a New Package

```bash
bun run new-package
```

The CLI will:
1. Ask for a **name** (camelCase or kebab-case)
2. Ask for a **description**
3. Ask for a **deploy target** (Cloud Run or Netlify)
4. Create the complete structure:
   - `packages/<name>/` with `src/index.ts`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`
   - `.embark.json` with deploy config
   - `netlify.toml` (if Netlify was chosen)
5. Auto-add to git

Then just commit — pre-commit hooks handle workflows, Dockerfiles, and README.

## Deploy Targets

### Cloud Run (default)

Auto-generates a GitHub Actions workflow and Dockerfile. On push, builds a Docker image and deploys to Cloud Run.

```json
// .embark.json
{ "deploy": "cloud-run" }
```

### Netlify

No workflow, no Dockerfile. Just a `netlify.toml`. Connect the repo on Netlify and every push auto-deploys.

```json
// .embark.json
{ "deploy": "netlify" }
```

### Other (custom)

For packages deployed elsewhere (Vercel, Fly.io, AWS, etc.). No workflow, no Dockerfile — you manage your own pipeline.

```json
// .embark.json
{ "deploy": "other" }
```

You can **mix all three** in the same monorepo — APIs on Cloud Run, frontends on Netlify, custom infra elsewhere.

## AI CLIs for Dockerfile Generation

When generating Dockerfiles with AI, you can choose your favorite AI provider. Install any (or all) of these CLIs:

### Copilot (GitHub)

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

### Claude (Anthropic)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### Codex (OpenAI)

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

### Gemini (Google)

```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

**Usage:** When creating a new package or generating a Dockerfile, Embark will ask which AI provider you'd like to use. The CLI will send your `package.json` and file structure to the chosen provider, which will generate an optimized Dockerfile.

## Pre-commit Hooks

On `git commit`, these scripts run automatically:

| Order | Script | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `ensure-deploy-config.ts` | Asks deploy target for packages missing `.embark.json` |
| 2 | `generate-workflows.ts` | Creates GitHub Actions workflow for new packages |
| 3 | `sync-workflows.ts` | Syncs existing workflows with template |
| 4 | `cleanup-orphan-workflows.ts` | Removes workflows for deleted/external packages |
| 5 | `generate-dockerfiles-ai.ts` | Generates Dockerfiles (AI or default) |
| 6 | `update-readme-packages.ts` | Updates the packages table in README |

## Pre-push Hooks

On `git push`, the full test suite runs. Push is blocked if tests fail.

## Structure

```
embark/
├── packages/                  # each folder is an independent app
│   └── showcase/              # showcase website
├── scripts/                   # monorepo automations
│   ├── create-package.ts      # interactive CLI to create packages

├── .github/workflows/         # auto-generated workflows (1 per package)
└── .husky/                    # git hooks
```

## Scripts

| Script | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `new-package` | `bun run new-package` | Interactively create a new package |
| `test` | `bun run test` | Run script tests with coverage |
| `sync-workflows` | `bun run sync-workflows` | Sync workflows with template |

## Tests

```bash
# run all tests with coverage
bun run test

# run a specific test
bun test scripts/__tests__/create-package.test.ts
```

Coverage threshold: **77%** (configured in `bunfig.toml`)

## Deploy (Cloud Run)

### Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | Google Cloud project ID |
| `GCP_SA_KEY` | Service account JSON (deploy permissions) |
| `GCP_REGION` | Cloud Run region (e.g. `us-central1`) |

### Deploy Flow

```
commit → push to main
  → GitHub Actions detects which packages/ changed
    → Build Docker image (only for changed packages)
      → Push to Artifact Registry
        → Deploy to Cloud Run
```

**Unchanged packages are never rebuilt or redeployed.**

## Release (Monorepo Versioning)

When changes are pushed to `main` **outside of `packages/`** (scripts, workflows, templates, docs), a release workflow automatically:

1. **Bumps version** — patch increment (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
2. **Updates `package.json`** — root monorepo version
3. **Updates README badges** — version badge reflects new version
4. **Creates Git tag** — e.g., `v1.0.1`
5. **Creates GitHub Release** — with automatic changelog

> **Note**: Changes inside `packages/` do NOT trigger releases. Each package manages its own versioning independently.

## Packages

<!-- PACKAGES:START -->
| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `showcase` | Embark showcase website — ship vibe-coded apps with zero-config CI/CD |
<!-- PACKAGES:END -->

### Showcase Website

The showcase demonstrates Embark's capabilities with an interactive, fully-animated landing page:

**Features:**
- 🎨 **Interactive Terminal** — Simulate the entire pre-commit pipeline with keyboard navigation (↑↓ arrows + Enter)
- 🎬 **Animated Sections** — Scroll-triggered animations using Three.js, GSAP, and ScrollTrigger
- 📱 **Responsive Design** — Glassmorphism UI with neon accents and dark theme
- 💻 **Real Workflow Visualization** — Side-by-side dual terminals showing Netlify + Cloud Run deployments
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Interactive** — Try different deployment paths with full keyboard support
- 🔄 **Reset Button** — Replay the simulation anytime

**Tech Stack:**
- Vite + vanilla TypeScript
- Three.js for 3D animations
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger for scroll effects
- Custom CSS with CSS variables
- Responsive and performance-optimized

**Running Locally:**
```bash
bun run --filter @embark/showcase dev
bun run --filter @embark/showcase build
```
